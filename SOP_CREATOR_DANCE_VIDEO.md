## 💃 The 5-Minute Movement Script

Your video is divided into **5 blocks of 1 minute each**. Each block has a different vibe and set of moves. Follow this sequence.

---

### 🟣 Block 1 — Minute 0:00–1:00 | "Slow Tease Intro"

**Energy:** Low and slow. Confident. You're drawing them in.

**Moves to do (cycle through, don't rush):**
- Slow hair flip to one side, then the other
- Run your hands from your hips up to your waist, then shoulders
- Slow body roll (bend knees slightly, roll hips → chest → shoulders upward)
- Walk toward the camera slowly, then walk back
- Hand frame your face (bring both hands close to your face like a frame, look through them)
- Slow shoulder drop — drop one shoulder down slowly and look over it

**Tip:** Pretend you're walking into a party and everyone just noticed you. Act like you own the room.

---

### 🔵 Block 2 — Minute 1:00–2:00 | "Energy Build"

**Energy:** Medium. You're warming up. Add some groove.

**Moves to do:**
- Two-step side to side (shift weight from foot to foot with rhythm)
- Hip circles — slow circles with your hips, both directions
- Bounce to the beat (even without music, pick a mental rhythm and bounce)
- Arm wave — one arm flows like a wave from shoulder to fingertips
- Head nod / groove head movement in sync with your body
- Point to the camera, wink, then go back to dancing
- "Pop and lock" hip — snap your hip sharply to one side and hold for a second

**Tip:** Look at the camera lens like it's a person you're flirting with.

---

### 🔴 Block 3 — Minute 2:00–3:00 | "Peak Energy"

**Energy:** High. This is your main performance energy. This is where the best clips come from.

**Moves to do:**
- Full body roll (from head down to knees in one smooth wave)
- Spin turn — a slow 360° turn, looking over your shoulder at the camera as you turn
- Drop it low (controlled squat down, then slowly back up)
- "Chest pop" — push chest forward sharply and hold
- Leg kick to the side (one leg swings out to the side, hand on hip)
- Shimmy — rapid shoulder shaking while hips stay relatively still
- Windmill arms — large circular arms while you sway

**Tip:** This is your "show off" minute. Go bigger, smile more, make eye contact with the lens.

---

### 🟡 Block 4 — Minute 3:00–4:00 | "Playful Gestures"

**Energy:** Medium-playful. Fun, relatable, trending content.

**Trending gestures to include (each for ~5–10 seconds):**
- 🫵 **Point at camera** — direct point, confident look
- 🤌 **Italian finger pinch** — chef's kiss or "this is perfect" gesture
- 💅 **Nails check** — hold hand out flat, examine your nails, then flip hair
- 👀 **Peek-a-boo eyes** — cover face with hands, slowly open like venetian blinds
- 🤷 **Shoulder shrug** with exaggerated "I don't know" face (playful, not serious)
- 💁 **Hair toss** — dramatic slow hair flip while looking away, then back at camera
- 🫦 **Lip bite** — subtle, don't overdo it (1–2 seconds max)
- 🕺 **Finger guns** — both hands, wink, point at camera and "shoot"

**Tip:** Think TikTok trending sounds and what people do in those videos. Be expressive with your face — your face IS the content here.

---

### 🟢 Block 5 — Minute 4:00–5:00 | "Slow Close"

**Energy:** Back to slow and confident. End strong.

**Moves to do:**
- Slow walk toward camera until you're close (face fills the screen), then slow walk back
- Mirror the Block 1 body roll — but this time, end it by looking up at the camera
- Hand over heart — bring one hand to your chest slowly, give a soft smile
- "Turn away and look back" — turn your back to camera, look over your shoulder seductively
- Slow wave goodbye (but make it elegant, not casual)
- Hold eye contact with the camera for 5 full seconds without moving — just breathe and look

**Tip:** Slow = powerful here. Don't rush. This is the outro that makes people want to follow you.

---

## 👗 Outfit Tips

- **Best for these videos:** Form-fitting outfits that show your body shape when moving (bodysuit, crop top + shorts, fitted dress)
- **Avoid:** Very loose/baggy clothing (movement won't read well on camera)
- **Shoes optional** — bare feet or heels both work. Flat sneakers work too.
- **Hair:** Down or in a way that moves — ponytails and buns reduce visual interest
- **Jewelry:** Fine — just don't let anything jingle loudly on the audio

---

## 🎤 Audio — Do This

Record in **silence** (no music playing). Our system adds music to the clips. If you film with music:
- We can't control audio licensing
- The beat won't align correctly with the 7-second cuts

You can listen to music through **one earbud** to keep rhythm if you need it — just keep the other ear free and make sure no audio bleeds into the mic.

---

| Stopping and restarting mid-video | Creates separate files, breaks our system |
| Background clutter or other people visible | Can't be published, must reshoot |
